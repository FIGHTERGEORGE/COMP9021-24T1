# Randomly generates a grid of 0s and 1s and determines
# the maximum number of "spikes" in a shape.
# A shape is made up of 1s connected horizontally or vertically (it can contain holes).
# A "spike" in a shape is a 1 that is part of this shape and "sticks out"
# (has exactly one neighbour in the shape).
# Neighbours are only considered vertically or horizontally (not diagonally).
# Note that a shape with a single 1 is also a spike.
