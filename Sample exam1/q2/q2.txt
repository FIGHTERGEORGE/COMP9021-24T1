Question 2
Write a function that accepts a strictly positive integer and displays its binary representation as well as the number of times the value 1 appears in its binary representation. You might find the function bin() useful.

Here are some execution examples:

    >>> f(1)
    1 in binary reads as: 1.
    Only one bit is set to 1 in the binary representation of 1.
    
    >>> f(2)
    2 in binary reads as: 10.
    Only one bit is set to 1 in the binary representation of 2.
    
    >>> f(3)
    3 in binary reads as: 11.
    2 bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of 3.
    
    >>> f(7)
    7 in binary reads as: 111.
    3 bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of 7.
    
    >>> f(2314)
    2314 in binary reads as: 100100001010.
    4 bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of 2314.
    
    >>> f(9871)
    9871 in binary reads as: 10011010001111.
    8 bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of 9871.
